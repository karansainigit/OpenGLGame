Contribution :

Designed all the pages for the game and implemented the navigation from these pages.

Also implemented transition logic of the levels with Nikita Arora (group member).

Designed the following pages:

Landing Page (implemented keyboard/mouse clicks on this page for navigation)
Introduction Page (implemented keyboard clicks on this page for navigation)
Game Menu screen (implemented keyboard/mouse clicks on this page for navigation)
Help page (implemented keyboard clicks on this page for navigation)
Credits page (implemented keyboard clicks on this page for navigation)
Pause page (implemented keyboard/mouse clicks on this page for navigation)
End page (implemented keyboard/mouse clicks on this page for navigation)

For transition of levels used variable 'number'. Initialize number=1 at the beginning for 1st Level.

If items calculated is equal to 80% of the items then level will be completed and number will be incremented by 1 for transitioning to next level.
